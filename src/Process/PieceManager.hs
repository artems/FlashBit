-- | The state of a piece. It is either Pending, Done or in Progress.
-- | The InProgress constructor describes pieces in progress of being downloaded.
--   we keep track of blocks which are pending as well as blocks which are done. We
--   also keep track of a count of the blocks. When a block is done, we cons it unto
--   @ipHaveBlocks@. When @ipHave == ipDone@, we check the piece for correctness. The
--   field @ipHaveBlocks@ could in principle be omitted, but for now it is kept since
--   we can use it for asserting implementation correctness. We note that both the
--   check operations are then O(1) and probably fairly fast.

-- | The Piece Database tracks the current state of the Torrent with respect to pieces.

--   that piece as done.

--   Better implementations for selecting among the pending Pieces is probably crucial
--   to an effective client, but we keep it simple for now.
